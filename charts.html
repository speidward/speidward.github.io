<h2>Excel</h2>

<p>The use of excel spreadsheets has been vital in the decision-making process for maintaining and growing Codex Fitness. When planning the original facility, we used the payment function in excel to compare the three buildings in the NH area that met the requirements for the gym. Each of the three buildings met the minimum requirements for the projected facility (in square footage, saftey standards, building composition) but were all priced differently with different loan periods. With a simple payment function we were able to calculate the monthly loan payment for each building, and by multiplying that by the loan period and number of payments per year, we were able to see the total cost of each building. Despite each building being priced similarly, we found that Building 1 had the lowest total cost at $2,196,975. With this information, we were able to confidently select building 1 as the oroginal Codex Fitness facility. We have used this same technique for every new chapter, as well as for comparing payment plans for the more expensive lifting equipment. </p>

<p>As a world-class power lifting gym, Codex Fitness equipment faces constant abuse far beyond what is expected of normal equipment. As a result, equipment is often left bent or broken, and must be replaced on a regular basis. To make this replacement process as quick as possible, we maintain an excel spreadsheet of regularly ordered equipment. This spreadsheet records brand, product name, price, and average shipping time. Using the vlookup function, we are easily able to pull the necessary replacements from a large data set by specifying the desired identifier in any column. We are able to immediately factor this pulled data into a larger spreadsheet that records our monthly expenditures and revenue. It also allows us, through sorting of the spreadsheet, to compare similar products to meet our needs. For example, if there is no rush for a replacement part, we look for the cheapest option. If we have an immediate need for the product, we look for the replacement with the shortest everage shipping time. </p>

<h2>Access</h2>

<img src="patrick.jpg" alt="squat depth" style="float:left;width:400px;height:350px;">

<p>Codex Fitness maintains a large clientele of professional power lifters who benefit from a variety of sponsorships. Each power lifter also respresents a different area of competition, with some lifters competing in the same area. Each area of competition is also divided into separate competitive leagues. Each lifter is assigned a trainer and a veteran mentor. We maintain all this redundant data through a number of tables in a microsoft access workbook. We connected these tables by primary keys and foreign keys based on dependencies in the data sets. From these relationships, we were able to use queries to pull specific records that met our criteria. For example, we were looking for what lifter was operating in the New England Iron League, assigned to trainer Michael Landry, with a strength total over 1800lbs. The query showed us that Patrick Maguire met all of these criteria. These results were obtained in a matter of seconds rather than the hours it would take to look through our raw data.</p>

"Codex Fitness is not the average gym. It's not part of a global chain. It's not run by any corporate affiliation. Just a couple top competitors who love to share their passion with the professional world." -Nolan Laakso
