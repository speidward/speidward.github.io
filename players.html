<h2>The Party</h2>

<p><b>Miffolous "Miff" Scuttleshanks</b>
<br>Race: Thri-Kreen
<br>Class: Gunslinger
<br>Role: Surgeon
<br>Bio: Thri-Kreen surgeon who earned his medical prowess by studying under the former ship doctor. Addicted to tobacco. Wields multiple pistols and cutlasses with his multiple arms and is self proclaimed “Fastest draw on the seas”. Goals: Find shiney treasure, eat tobacco, reproduce with sexy bug ladies, and I guess keep the crew alive (if only I knew human anatomy better). 
<br>Backstory: Miff grew up in the great deserts hunting and learning the ways of his tribe until the age of 2. When Miff became 2 and due to growing dangers in the great sands there was an exodus to the shores. When he reached society he was 3 and almost fully grown but was outcast due to his primitive nature. He decided to focus on education and fitting into society. He ran into a ship surgeon who did not judge him on his appearance or stereotype and taught him medicine as a practice. When the surgeon had to ship out onto open waters Miff snuck aboard as a stowaway but was found and forced to become one of the crew slowly learning under the pirate surgeon.</p>

<p><b>Whitey Tippyblue</b>
<br>Race: Kenku
<br>Class: Musketeer/Sharpshooter
<br>Role: Lookout
<br>Backstory: Whitey grew up in a remote port town inhabited commonly by less desirable seafarers. The son of a tavern whore and a small time pirate marksman, Whitey learned early on just how tough life can be for an undesirable. Throughout his adolescence he learned to be quick and deadly with a long rifle and other assorted firearms. His days were spent at the port town, drinking, gambling, practicing his marksmanship, and generally squawking about, until one day his life would change dramatically. After being caught cheating in a round of craps by a visiting merchant, he was run out of the little port town on fear of his life. In order to survive, he enlisted his services with the nation’s naval forces.
<br>A fearsome shot in battle, he earned many an award for his marksmanship. After the battle of Tippecanoe however, he bumped his head on a piece of driftwood while falling into the sea, and sunk to the bottom. Resurfacing minutes after the battle was over, he was fished out by a pirate crew, and held for questioning. The strangest thing is, though, after coming about, he had become the strangest breed of lunatic, squawking about the sweet smell of gunpowder and how he would earn his wings when he had shot an angel out of the sky. Some say it was the saltwater did him in, others the bonk on the noggin, all that matters was that he was officially off his rocker and now a part of a swashbuckling pirate crew, now and forevermore!

<p><b>Swampheart</b>
<br>Race: Drow
<br>Class: Warlock
<br>Role: Quartermaster
<br>Bio: Swampheart has dark skin like all drow, and dull red eyes. There are all manner of charms, tokens, feathers and beads interwoven in his light brown, matted and dreadlocked hair. His nails have been file-sharpened into claws. He wears a necklace of miniature skulls carved from hard wood and hollowed out finger bones. He is adorned with traditional, loose woven cloths of a variety of textures and earthy colors that completely cover his skin as well as a wide, circular reed hat during the day to protect from the sun. This also makes it difficult for others to identify him as a drow during the night time, only the reflection of his eyes visible from behind his hair. He has a satchel that contains a collection of trinkets, charms and components that he uses to channel the power instilled within him by the night aspect.
<br>Backstory: Swampheart grew up hearing stories of the fall of the elves from his grandmother. He listened to her tales of the great war between the elves and the humans, of how she defended Mordheim with all her might, and about the dark pact their people made with Nocturn all those years ago that every drow inherits to this day. Since childhood he has dedicated his life to exploring the nature of realm that keeps them prisoner, studying how to bend the mystical energies of the eternal darkness to his will in the ancient school with his kin. It’s with a twisted amusement Swampheart uses these powers against those who inhabit the material plane, especially humans and elves, seeing it as just deserts for the pain their race endured at their hands thousands of years ago. Often times his visage and the otherworldly shadow that surrounds him is enough to make an enemy throw down their weapons in surrender, and if they are lucky they will do so at a time when Swampheart does not have any new magical techniques to try out. 
<br>For all his spite, Swampheart is no fool. To him, the flowing magic of the eternal darkness is a tool, and powerful one at that. He understands that while he could incinerate a man or drive a man mad with a simple glare, the high seas are too dangerous for anyone to take on without allies. One does not gain allies if their talents are not used judiciously, be it marksmanship, fantastic strength, or adeptness with magic. Swampheart has seen many drow fail in recognizing this fact, the absolute power of the eternal darkness corrupting their souls absolutely until they destroy themselves, and it this corruption that all of his kind must vigilantly resist. A loose cannon does not last long on the seas. In return Swampheart has found that many individuals of the other races are tolerable, even worth working with.

<p><b>Tal Agal Pogger</b>
<br>Race: Treelok
<br>Class: Druid
<br>Role: Navigator
<br>Bio: Primarily uses a sharpened quarterstaff/spear in battle along with some poisonous darts (Ma’s secret recipe). Particularly fond of small unevolved sea-frog pet named Dale. Dale occasionally croaks, but otherwise doesn’t do much. Agal Pogger believes all government is detrimental to life and impedes connection to nature, thus should be abolished. Extremely adept at navigating through the seas, but fairly average on land. Agal Pogger has anxiety when out of sight and far away from any body of water, and this anxiety severely impedes his ability to navigate and generally function. 
<br>Backstory: After earning the highly-regarded title of Tal in the Great War after successfully navigating a small fleet of ships across treacherous waters and to several victories under the the flag of Atlia, Agal Pogger became disillusioned with his nation after its poor treatment of sea life and coastal ecosystems, choosing to instead join the pirate nation to champion his radical anti-establishment views. Coming from a long line of proud navigators and druids, Agal Pogger holds a deep connection and bond with all sea life, often keeping small sea creatures around as both friends and pets.

<p><b>Ansley Fulton</b>
<br>Race: Human Ghost
<br>Class: Fighter
<br>Role: Captain
<br>Cause of Death: Infection/ botched surgery 
<br>Possession: Captain Ansley can assume control over his crew members at will, using their stats but retaining the skills and class he had from his time alive. Ansley is unable to  Being possessed may cause nausea and brief bouts vomiting upon entrance. A possessed crewmember can be identified by their stiff posture and the faint echo of Captain Ansley’s voice under their own when speaking. He is only able to possess members of his crew, as they are considered part of his ship. He can walk through walls, but is unable to physically interact with objects when outside of a body.
<br>Backstory: After a boarding-gone-wrong, Ansley found himself bedridden with a grim abdominal wound. It seemed that he would make a recovery before the gasp suddenly became infected, and forced a risky surgery to possibly save his life. Unfortunately for him, the ship’s only surgeon was a thri-kreen that never seemed to grasp human physiology. One tragic evening later, the ship found itself without a captain. Ansley was given a ceremonious burial at sea in all his finery. The first mate was named his successor, and stepped into the captain’s quarters to assume his new role. Much to his surprise, he found a spectral image of Captain Ansley poring over maps, furiously muttering to himself. Upon noticing the intruder, the ghost glared at the first mate. “Get back to work, you freeloader! We have to keep searching!” He yelled.  Ever since that day, the crew has continued on their journey, still at the mercy of their deceased captain. None know what they’re searching for, but they do not question it. The pay is good now that the captain has no interest in taking the lion’s share of plunder for himself. The downside to their ghostly leader is his tendency to force himself into the bodies of his crewmen whenever he needs to interact with the physical world.
