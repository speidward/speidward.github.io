<h3>Creation</h3>

<p> In the beginning there was only darkness. Nocturn drowned the world in unending night, and evil creatures roamed freely. Then, a hero arose from the race of man, Asur. Asur the first wizard, created fire. Striking an agreement with the ancient elves and dwarves, the united races weaponized fire and fought back against the monsters. So great was the warmth of humanity’s hope that it ignited a passion in Nocturn’s bosom. As fate commanded, Sol erupted from his brother, bring the first day to the world. 
<br>Asur aged, becoming a great sorcerer and the champion of the long day, yet Nocturn was not defeated. After years of constant light, Sol realized that his beloved mortals no longer appreciated his salvation. He decided that balance was necessary for world, and conceded half of his existence to Nocturn. Night returned to the world and the mortals were afraid again, but Sol returned again on the next day. Asur, wise beyond his years, understood Sol’s message and brought his people together. Every dawn they thanked Sol for his blessing, and every night they slept and awaited the following day.

<h3>Nations</h3>


<p>There are three great empires in the NorthWest; Riban, Atlia, and Ofina. Each is composed of smaller nations which are ruled by national governors that report directly to an Emperor. Each empire is similar in structure with a central currency, empire-wide and national tax system, and free trade networks. 
<br><br>10 years ago, a fierce naval war was fought between the three Northern Empires. While no great armies were dispatched, each empire intended to inflict financial ruin on their enemies by destroying their fleets and ports.
<br><br>After 8 years of fighting with no substantial power shifts and significant costs, the Northern Empires abandoned the conflict and negotiated a ceasefire. Old trade routes were restored and life returned to normal for the imperial citizens. A large portion of the privateers that served in that brutal naval war have since become pirates and currently harass peaceful vessels in the Sea of Tethys.

<h3>World Religion</h3>

<p>There exists one major god of life, change, and balance. He is both the brother and the sister, Sol and Nocturn. Sol resides inside the sun and bestows his blessing upon the world through his divine rays of light. He brings warmth and comfort to the world during the day. Nocturn is the darkness that shadows the world; she steals away the warmth of day and lays low the progress of man. Both are required for proper balance to exist. Just as the sun’s rays touch every person differently, Sol’s personality manifests differently depending on where you are in the world, and there are a variety of interpretations and faiths built around these different manifestations. It is believed that the stars in the night sky are the souls of the honored dead, patiently enduring Nocturn’s cool embrace until they are worthy of entering the beauty and warmth of Sol’s domain.
<br><br>Besides Sol there are several divine beings that inhabit this world, said to be Sol’s children. Each being resides in a chosen domain and has vast power over that area. These are beings of immense power and are often locally worshipped for their blessings or to avoid their wrath. Legends speak of ancient warriors who were able to strike down these gods in single combat. These mortal champions obtain a portion of that god’s divine power, and use that power to change the world as they see fit. There are several incredibly bright stars in the night sky, these are commonly regarded as the souls of those ancient gods who were defeated, still waiting to return to their father.
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tethys, Calm God of the Tethys Sea:</b> Appearing as a great octopus, Tethys is said to live in a massive coral palace at the bottom of his sea. Tethys is a loving caretaker who blesses sailors with strong trade winds and calm seas.</li>
<li><b>Nijene, Protective God of the Nijene Sea:</b> Taking the form of a massive ray, Nijene is said to guard the Nijene Sea from southern invaders. It is thanks to her constant watch that the NorthWestern Empires have been allowed to prosper, safe from the Southern conquerors.</li>
<li><b>Yradin, Distant Father of the Sky:</b> Often referred to as the father of the Elf race, Yradin appears as a great eagle and glides high on the winds. As the elf race has split and fallen into disarray, he is looked upon with disdain for abandoning his children.</li>
<li><b>Ocēlōtl, Guardian of the Jungle:</b> Spoken of in whispers, Ocēlōtl is the great jaguar that stalks the forests of Oryth. The jungle holds many secrets, and Ocēlōtl looks to keep those secrets hidden from the world.</li>
<li><b>Maulwurf, Master of Tunnels:</b> Maulwurf is depicted as a great mole that digs vast tunnels under the mountains of Nosogov. His droppings contain rare and valuable minerals that bring great wealth to the intrepid miners of Nosogov.</li>
<li><b>Uta, the Lost Salvation:</b> Uta, the great camel, was charged by Sol with bringing salvation to the desert of Bursk. Wherever he trode, life-saving water sprang from the sand. Years ago, Uta disappeared. The stalwart people of the desert lamented his absence as their water supplies ran dry. Due to its now-inhospitable nature, they were forced to abandon the desert and seek a new life on the coast.</li>
<li><b>Badura, the Screaming Watcher:</b> Said to appear as a great bat, Badura nests in the great caves on the coast of Norhollow. His screeches fill the night air as he hunts with his swarm, protecting the innocent from the numberless pests that would spread disease across the land.</li>
<li><b>Bobbejaan, the Force of Nature:</b> Taking the form of a great baboon, Bobbejaan parades through the jungles of Tammarand. Jungle law is survival of the fittest, and Bobbejaan enforces this law with grim resolve.</li>
<li><b>Kalt, Mother of the Lost:</b> Appearing as a great white bear, Kalt wanders the great tundra of southern Svetheim. Many a man has found himself lost in the tundra with temperatures plummeting. As they fall to their knees, praying for salvation, Kalt appears before them, taking the hopeless into her mouth like a cub, and carrying them to safety.</li>
<li><b>Froskur, Decider of Fates:</b> Froskur, appearing as a great frog, resides in the swamplands of Waldermore. The sick and dying are brought before him, and told to drink from the waters around him. Those who still have purpose in this world are granted salvation, and cured of their affliction; those who have served their purpose are granted a quick death, and join their ancestors in the night sky.</li>

<h2>Fall of the Elves</h2>

<p>In the years following the first day, the elves were a united, graceful people. Elves were naturally gifted with longer lifespans and enhanced magical abilities, and after years of progression young elves were being assigned to a specific school of learning where they would most succeed. There were four schools, each dedicated to a different domain; the school of air, the school of the forest, the school of the sea, and the school of darkness. Each school looked to gain mastery over their domain. 
<br><br>In the year 476 AD (after-dawn), humanity fell into a brutal civil war. Two descendents of Asur - the twins Furor and Osur - both claimed the title of Emperor after the death of their father, Asur IV. The brothers had very different opinions on the place of humans in the world; Furor believed that humanity was by birthright the dominant race and should rule over the “lesser races,” Isur believed that humans should work in harmony with the other races, as it had always been. Half of the human population rallied behind each brother, and battle-lines were quickly drawn. 
<br><br>The elves were put in a hard predicament; the elves had no desire to shed their own blood over a human conflict. They also could not ignore the fact that Furor would see them enslaved. The elders of each school of learning could not come to an agreement. In what would later be called the defining moment of the elven race, the followers of the school of air fled. Scared for their own survival, they abandoned their kin and moved to a great city in the sky that they had been developing in secret. The followers of the school of the sea fled to the sea. They sought refuge in the kingdom of Tethys, confining themselves to life at the bottom of the sea. At this time, an army of Furor’s men marched on the great elven city of Mordheim. The followers of the school of the forest and the school of darkness were united in defending their city, but when the first humans broke through, the followers of the school of the forest fled into the wilderness. The school of darkness, not realizing it had been abandoned, to defend its home, but it was not enough. Few were able to retreat to the inner sanctum of their central temple. Nagash, the leader of the school, made a dark pact to protect his remaining people. He pledged his immortal soul to the service of Nocturn, and in return they were allowed to flee to the realm of eternal darkness. 
<br><br>Nocturn failed to mention that those who enter her domain are bound to it, and the followers of the school of darkness remain their today. The constant darkness seeped into their very souls, and now they appear as the drow, a hateful race of dark elves who resent both humans and elves alike. Drow raids from the plane of darkness are quick, deadly, and unexpected. Mortals of all kind know one thing when dealing with drow raiders; don’t let them take you alive.
<br><br>The followers of the school of air, now known as high elves, still reside high above the physical world, looking on the world below with hypocritical disdain. They have been known to occasionally interact with the earth-bound races, but only when it is beneficial to them. 
<br><br>The followers of the school of the sea, the deepkin, are hideously deformed from their time spent at the bottom of the ocean. Most of the lower class is blind, relying on echolocation. Members of the upper class are gifted natural magic users, able to bind powerful marine creatures to their will and use them for nefarious purposes.
<br><br>The followers of the school of the forest haven’t been officially spotted in over 1000 years. There are occasional unconfirmed reports of mysterious elven figures wearing the skins of animals in the great forests of Oryth.
